# Lambda Wars - Enhancement Mod
Welcome to the Lambda Wars Enhancement Mod, here we will post many new updates for the game/mod Lambda Wars, since the developers are working rarely on the game/mod.
# Installation
To install this mod, you have to goto your Lambda Wars Game directory which should be where your steam games are located at = Steam/steamapps/common/Lambda Wars/lambdawars
there you will have to make a folder called "addons" and then you will have to move the installed VPK inside the addons folder. And then you are free to go to have fun.
*This mod will not work when the lobby members do not have the same VPK as the host.*
# *Combine Faction*
## New Units
- Combine Technician [Able to build cover buildings]
- Metro Police (Medic) [Able to build regeneration posts]
